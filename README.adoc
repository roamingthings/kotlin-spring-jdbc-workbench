= Workbench project for Spring (Boot) and JDBC in Kotlin

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/roamingthings/kotlin-spring-jdbc-workbench.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/roamingthings/kotlin-spring-jdbc-workbench)

This project is used by me to tinker around with Spring (Boot) and JDBC in Kotlin.

It will evolve over time and you may find it in a state where it's weired or not working very well.
